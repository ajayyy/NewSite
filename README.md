# A minimilist site

This is a new more minimalist site with CSS animations I created for myself.

This also includes a feature to automatically create a "development blog" from utopian.io posts. This also will add syntax highlighting to the blog, and convert the markdown to html using highlight.js and markdown-it.

# Usage

This is created with pure HTML, CSS and JS. This can be hosted by any webserver, even GitHub pages. My site is accessible at https://ajay.app. This is hosted with GitHub pages.
